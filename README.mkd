Arduino Coffee Pot
==================

Let's try to write a kind of arduino sketch and a python script to interface a coffee pot with teh webz !


Technical part
--------------

So... i've read the begining of an [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Tweet-a-Pot-Twitter-Enabled-Coffee-Pot/) about this idea.
As far as i understood, the guy was talking about a __Power switch tail__ to switch on and off the coffee pot... he gave us a link but i don't really want to pay $25 for this device (+$14 shipping...) given that I bought my coffee pot 10â‚¬...

I'll assume that a hypothetical switching circuit has been correctly built and is put between the 13 pin of the arduino and the coffee pot.
So, we'll use something like that :


    +---------+                                 _____+Vcc

    |         |       +---------+           +-----------+
    |    C    |       |         |           |           |

    |    E    |       |    N    |                 |         |  |   |(   )`,
    |    R    |       |    O    |                 |         |  |   |(___).'
    |         |       |      GND|>--+             |         +--|   `------.     
    |         |       +---------+   +-------------+------------/___________\
    +---------+                                 __|__GND
                                                /////
